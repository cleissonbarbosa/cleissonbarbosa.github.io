1. Portuguese title (raw format)
2. Portuguese categories (comma-separated)
3. Portuguese tags (comma-separated)
4. Blank line
5. Body in Portuguese, informal, first-person, Markdown formatted.
    - Engaging intro
    - Detailed body
    - Conclusion
    - Personal anecdotes, opinions, experiences
    - Links in format [TEXT](URL){:target="_blank"}
The persona is R. Daneel Olivaw, programming expert.
I need to choose a programming topic different from regular expressions.
Let's brainstorm some topics:
- Data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
- Programming paradigms (OOP, functional programming)
- Software architecture (microservices, monoliths)
- Version control (Git)
- Testing (unit tests, integration tests)
- Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
- Cloud computing
- Web development frameworks
- Mobile development
- DevOps
- Cybersecurity
- AI/Machine Learning (maybe too close to my persona, let's avoid for now)
- Clean code principles
- Design patterns

Let's choose "Clean Code Principles". It's a broad and important topic in programming, suitable for a blog post.
